# Learning log — Day 1-2

A clean, sequential review of every concept introduced today, separate from the
blow-by-blow debugging. Read this top to bottom as the "what did I actually learn" version.

---

## 1. React — the component model

**What it is:** a JavaScript library for building UIs out of small, reusable pieces
called *components*, each with its own local *state* (data that can change).

**Core idea:** when a component's state changes, React automatically re-renders
just that piece of the page — you never manually find and update HTML elements yourself.

**Where we used it:** every `.tsx` file in `frontend/app/` is a component.
`layout.tsx` is the shared shell (nav); `page.tsx` is the home page content.

---

## 2. Next.js — the framework built on React

**What it is:** React alone gives you components; Next.js adds routing (which URL
shows which page), a dev server, and the production build process.

**Key commands:**
```
npx create-next-app@14 frontend   # scaffold a new project (pinned to v14, see §7)
npm run dev                        # start local dev server at localhost:3000
```

**Version note:** Next.js 15+ requires Node 20.9+; we're on Next.js 14, which only
needs Node 18.17+ — this pin was a direct consequence of the Node/macOS constraint in §7.

---

## 3. Tailwind CSS

**What it is:** a styling approach where you apply CSS via class names directly in
your markup (`className="text-2xl font-medium"`) instead of writing separate stylesheet files.

**Why it's common in industry:** faster iteration, no inventing class names, styles
stay colocated with the component that uses them.

---

## 4. FastAPI — the backend framework

**What it is:** a Python framework for defining HTTP endpoints — URLs the frontend
can call to get or send data (`/health`, later `/api/chat`, `/api/score`).

**Why the backend has to exist separately from the frontend:** secrets (API keys),
heavy computation, and database access need to live somewhere the browser can't see
or tamper with. That "somewhere" is the backend server.

**Key commands:**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload      # run locally at localhost:8000
```

---

## 5. Client-server request flow (why we deploy *two* separate services)

Two distinct round trips, at two different times:

1. **Page load (once):** browser → frontend service → gets back HTML + JS bundle.
   This is what the frontend deployment is *for* — without it, there's no page for
   anyone to visit, and no JS ever gets downloaded to run.
2. **Interaction (whenever the user does something):** the JS that arrived in step 1
   is now running *inside the browser*, and it's that browser code that calls the
   backend URL directly and gets back JSON.

**Practical implication:** only the frontend URL is ever shared publicly (it's "the site").
The backend URL is an API — reachable, but not meant to be browsed directly.

**Coming later, not yet configured:** because frontend and backend live on two
different domains, browsers block cross-domain requests by default (CORS) unless the
backend explicitly allows the frontend's URL.

---

## 6. Docker — containerization (built, but not run locally — see §7)

**The problem it solves:** "works on my machine" happens when your exact Python
version + dependencies + OS libraries aren't reproducible elsewhere.

**What a Dockerfile is:** a recipe that builds an identical, isolated environment
every time, regardless of where it's built.

**Line-by-line, from `backend/Dockerfile`:**
| Line | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `FROM python:3.12-slim` | start from a minimal pre-built Python image |
| `WORKDIR /app` | set the working directory *inside* the container |
| `COPY requirements.txt .` + `RUN pip install ...` | install dependencies **before** copying app code, so Docker can cache this step and skip re-installing when only code changes |
| `COPY app ./app` | copy the actual application code in |
| `EXPOSE 8080` | documents which port the container listens on |
| `CMD [...]` | the command that runs when the container **starts** |

---

## 7. The macOS version wall (the day's recurring theme)

**Root cause, discovered repeatedly:** the laptop is on macOS Big Sur (11.7.10),
released 2020. Most current dev tooling (Node 20+, Docker Desktop, Homebrew's
"Tier 2" source builds, GitHub CLI's `.pkg` and even its raw binary) now requires
macOS 12 or 13+.

**Pattern learned — three ways to route around an OS-version wall, in order of preference:**
1. **Pin an older tool version** that still supports your OS (Node 18 via `nvm`,
   Next.js 14 instead of `@latest`) — the cleanest fix when available.
2. **Skip the package manager, use a precompiled binary/installer directly** —
   bypasses Homebrew's from-source builds (worked for Node, once pinned to v18).
3. **If even the binary was compiled against newer OS APIs, stop and switch
   approach entirely** rather than trying a fourth workaround for the same wall
   (this is what happened with `gh` — pivoted to a Personal Access Token instead).

**Concrete resolutions today:**
- Node → installed via `nvm`, pinned to v18 (not `--lts`, which grabs a too-new version)
- Next.js → pinned to `@14` via `create-next-app@14`
- Docker Desktop → **parked entirely**; not needed because Google Cloud Build can
  containerize source code in the cloud without a local Docker install
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) → **abandoned**; used a Personal Access Token instead

---

## 8. Google Cloud Run + Cloud Build

**What Cloud Run is:** a service that runs containers and only charges for actual
usage (scales to zero when idle) — this is why it suits a free-tier personal project.

**How we deployed without Docker installed locally:**
```
gcloud run deploy <service-name> --source . --region us-central1 --allow-unauthenticated
```
`--source .` uploads your code to Google, which builds the container *in the cloud*
via Cloud Build — either using buildpacks (auto-detects language from files like
`package.json`) or, if present, an actual `Dockerfile` in the folder (this is what
happened for `backend/`, since we had one; the buildpack path is what ran for
`frontend/`, since it has no Dockerfile).

**One real config bug hit and fixed:** Cloud Run injects a `PORT` environment
variable and expects the container to listen on it — our Dockerfile had a hardcoded
`--port 8000`. Fixed by using `${PORT:-8080}` in the `CMD`, which requires the
shell form of `CMD` (`sh -c "..."`) rather than the JSON-array form, since env var
substitution needs a shell to evaluate it.

---

## 9. IAM & service accounts (Google Cloud's permission system)

**Core idea:** every actor in Google Cloud — including automated processes like
Cloud Build — is an *identity* that needs to be explicitly granted permission
(a "role") to do specific things. Nothing is trusted by default.

**Roles granted today, and why each was needed:**
| Role | Needed for |
|---|---|
| `roles/storage.objectViewer` | reading uploaded source code during build |
| `roles/artifactregistry.writer` | pushing the built container image |
| `roles/editor` (on the CI service account specifically) | broad grant for GitHub Actions — a deliberate simplification, see devlog |

**Pattern learned:** on a brand-new project, expect to hit a *sequence* of
"permission denied" errors, each naming the exact missing role — grant it, retry,
repeat. This is normal, not a sign something is broken.

---

## 10. Git + GitHub authentication

**What changed industry-wide (not new today, but relevant):** GitHub removed
plain password authentication for git operations in 2021. Logging into the website
via Google/SSO doesn't substitute — git needs its own credential.

**Options, in order attempted today:**
1. `gh` CLI's browser-based login → blocked by the macOS version wall (§7)
2. **Personal Access Token (PAT)** → what we ended up using: a token generated on
   GitHub's website, pasted in place of a password when git prompts for one.
   Needed the **`repo`** scope for normal pushes, plus **`workflow`** scope
   specifically to push changes inside `.github/workflows/`.

---

## 11. CI/CD — GitHub Actions

**What "CI/CD" means:** Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment — automatically
testing and deploying code on every push, instead of doing it by hand each time.

**Where the pipeline definition lives:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, written in
YAML, committed *in the repo itself* — this is "config as code": the deployment
process is version-controlled and identical for anyone who clones the repo, not
hidden in a dashboard's settings.

**How a `git push` actually triggers a cloud deploy:** nothing runs on your laptop.
GitHub's own servers detect the push, spin up a temporary VM, check out your code
onto it, and run each step in the YAML file there — including the `gcloud run deploy`
commands. Your laptop's only job was pushing the code.

**Structure of the workflow file:**
- `on:` → what triggers it (a push to `main`)
- `jobs:` → the sequence of steps that run

**What "lint" means:** static analysis — scanning code for style issues and obvious
bugs *without running it*. Cheap and fast (seconds) compared to catching the same
issue after a full deploy.

---

## 12. Workload Identity Federation (WIF)

**The problem it solves:** the naive way to let GitHub Actions deploy to Google
Cloud is to create a long-lived key file and store it as a GitHub secret. That key
is a standing liability if it ever leaks. Our project's org policy actually
*blocked* key creation outright, which forced the better solution.

**How WIF works instead:** Google Cloud is configured to directly trust identity
tokens that GitHub itself issues. When the workflow runs, GitHub proves "this is
really a run of `fang407/profile-site`," and Google exchanges that proof for a
short-lived credential on the spot. No password or key file exists at any point,
stored or otherwise.

**Pieces set up:**
1. A **Workload Identity Pool** — a container for trusted external identities
2. A **Provider** inside it — configured to trust GitHub's token issuer specifically,
   restricted via `--attribute-condition` to only this one repo
3. A **service account** (`github-deployer`) that the pool is allowed to impersonate
4. Three GitHub repo secrets (`GCP_PROJECT_ID`, `WIF_PROVIDER`, `WIF_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`)
   referencing the above — none of them are credentials themselves, just identifiers

**Industry note:** this is the currently recommended pattern for CI-to-cloud auth
generally, not a workaround specific to our situation — worth knowing that the
"harder" path here was actually the better-practice one.

---

## Sequence, end to end (how it all connects)

```
git push
   │
   ▼
GitHub detects the push → spins up a runner
   │
   ▼
Runner checks out code, installs deps, runs lint
   │
   ▼
Runner authenticates to Google Cloud via WIF (no stored key)
   │
   ▼
Runner runs `gcloud run deploy` for backend and frontend
   │
   ▼
Google Cloud Build containerizes each (Dockerfile for backend,
buildpack auto-detection for frontend) and deploys to Cloud Run
   │
   ▼
Two live public URLs — frontend is "the site," backend is the API
it calls from the visitor's own browser
```

# Learning log — Day 3

## 13. File-based routing (Next.js App Router)

**Core idea:** the folder structure under `app/` directly becomes the URL structure —
there's no separate routing config to maintain. Creating `app/resume/page.tsx`
automatically makes `/resume` a real route.

**What each special filename means:**
| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `page.tsx` | the actual content shown at that route |
| `layout.tsx` | a wrapping shell — can exist at the root (applies everywhere) or inside any route folder (applies to just that section and its children) |

We're only using the root `layout.tsx` so far (the shared nav), but any section
could get its own nested `layout.tsx` later if it needed distinct chrome the
others don't.

## 14. Component composition (small reusable pieces inside one page)

`page.tsx` isn't one big blob of markup — it defines small local components
(`SectionTitle`, `Check`) and reuses them repeatedly. This is the same "component"
idea from Day 1's counter demo, just applied at a smaller scale: instead of
writing `<h2 className="...">Skills</h2>` and `<h2 className="...">Experience</h2>`
separately, `<SectionTitle>Skills</SectionTitle>` guarantees every section heading
looks identical and only needs updating in one place.

**Data-driven rendering:** the resume content itself lives in plain JS arrays/objects
(`SKILLS`, `EXPERIENCE`) at the top of the file, and the JSX below just `.map()`s
over them. This separates *content* from *layout* — editing a bullet point means
editing data, not markup.

## 15. Design tokens — the payoff of naming colors instead of hardcoding them

**What we did:** rather than writing `bg-[#EDF0EA]` directly in the page, we defined
named tokens (`canvas`, `ink`, `sage`, `mint`, `mint-soft`, `hairline`) once in
`tailwind.config.js`, and every component references the *names*.

**Why it mattered today, concretely:** switching the entire site's theme from warm
charcoal to soft sage took editing exactly one file (`tailwind.config.js`) — zero
changes to `layout.tsx` or `resume/page.tsx`, because they never referenced a raw
color, only a token name. This is the general principle behind design systems in
real products: indirection now (name it once) saves rework later (swap the
definition, not every usage).

## Recurring bug pattern, now confirmed twice

Both "Unexpected token" build errors (Day 1 and Day 3) trace to an identical
failure: a copy-pasted JSX block silently lost its opening `<a` tag, and the
compiler reported the error several lines away from the actual problem. Worth
trusting this pattern going forward: if a build error mentions `Unexpected
token` on a line that looks completely normal, check nearby `href=`/attribute
lines for a tag missing its name — `grep -n 'href='` is a fast way to scan for
it before even opening the browser.

# Learning log — Day 5

## 16. Embeddings & vector space intuition

**Core idea:** an embedding turns text into a list of numbers — a point in
space — positioned so that text with *similar meaning* ends up nearby, even if
the wording shares no words at all ("debugged a flaky test" and "the CI
pipeline caught a bug" land close together despite minimal word overlap).

**Why this matters for RAG:** a user's question gets embedded into a point in
this same space, and the system finds whichever stored chunks are *nearest* —
retrieval by meaning, not keyword matching.

## 17. Prompt engineering basics

A good system prompt generally has three parts:
- **Role** — who/what the model is acting as ("you're answering questions
  about Fang's resume")
- **Boundaries** — what to do when a question falls outside scope (politely
  decline and redirect, rather than answering anyway or refusing rudely)
- **Format guidance** — length/tone defaults ("2-4 sentences unless asked for
  more detail")

## 18. Chunking strategy and content organization

**Goal:** group content by *topic coherence*, so a single retrieved chunk
answers one kind of question well rather than being a grab-bag of loosely
related facts.

**Naming discipline for chunk IDs:** name each chunk after its *purpose*
(what kind of question it answers), not just its literal contents — e.g.
`internship_experience` rather than `dyson_panasonic`. The ID is never shown
to a user, but a purpose-driven name makes the content file maintainable later.

**A genuine judgment call worth remembering:** overlapping categories (e.g.
scholarships could reasonably live under "education" or "awards") are best
resolved by asking which *kind of question* each item answers — splitting
pure academic facts from recognition/awards kept both more retrievable.

## 19. Chroma as an embedded vector database

Chroma isn't a server your app calls over a network — for a project this
size, it's a library that runs *inside* your own Python process and writes to
a local folder (`chroma_db/`), conceptually similar to SQLite. It never talks
to Gemini directly; your own code is the middleman both ways.

## 20. How Chroma, Gemini, and your code fit together

```
Ingest:  your code → Gemini (embed each chunk) → Chroma (store vector + text)
Query:   your code → Gemini (embed the question) → Chroma (find nearest vectors)
         → Chroma returns matching TEXT → your code → Gemini again (LLM call,
         this time to write an answer using that text as context)
```

## 21. Industrial practices for vector search

- **Same embedding model for ingest and query, always** — mixing models
  breaks similarity search, since "nearness" only means something within one
  model's own space.
- **Asymmetric task types** — `task_type="retrieval_document"` at ingest vs.
  `"retrieval_query"` at query time; good embedding APIs optimize these
  differently since a question and its answer don't look alike as raw text.
- **Metadata filtering** — attaching category/date metadata to chunks so you
  can narrow the candidate set before doing similarity search, useful once
  content grows large.

## 22. Why local persistence doesn't survive Cloud Run

Cloud Run's disk is like a rented hotel room, not an owned apartment — every
container start (redeploy, scale-up, automatic restart) gets a **brand-new,
empty filesystem**. A `PersistentClient` writing to a local folder works
perfectly on a laptop (whose disk genuinely persists) but loses everything the
moment the same code runs inside Cloud Run. Flagged as a known gap to solve
before this matters for real deployment, not fixed yet.

## 23. Gemini's two distinct roles

The same "Gemini" umbrella covers two functionally separate models used for
two different jobs in this project:
- **Embedding model** (e.g. `gemini-embedding-001`) — turns text into a vector.
  Used twice: once per chunk at ingest, once per question at query time.
- **Chat/LLM model** (e.g. `gemini-flash-latest`) — takes retrieved text plus
  a question and writes an actual natural-language answer. Chroma never
  produces formatted answers itself — it only ever returns raw stored text.

## 24. Model deprecation and verifying against current docs

`models/text-embedding-004` — the model name originally used — turned out to
already be deprecated by Google. AI tooling/model names move fast enough that
even confident-sounding instructions can be stale; checking current official
docs before trusting a specific model/API name is a real, recurring
discipline, not a one-off fluke.

## 25. Two separate Google billing systems

**Google Cloud Billing** (the GCP trial credit used for Cloud Run/Build) and
**Gemini API / AI Studio billing** are entirely separate ledgers — funding one
does not affect the other. A specific error ("prepayment credits are
depleted") turned out to be a known, currently-reported Google-side bug tied
to projects with an active GCP trial specifically; switching to a plain
"Free tier" API key (no GCP trial attached) sidestepped it entirely.

**Related, separate issue also hit this day:** even a working key can have
per-model free-tier quota set to `0` for a specific model version, independent
of overall account status. `genai.list_models()` reveals which models a key
can call *at all*, but not which currently have non-zero free quota — the
`-latest` aliases (e.g. `gemini-flash-latest`) are a more durable choice than
pinning an exact version number, since Google keeps them pointed at whichever
model currently sits in the free tier.

## RAG pipeline, end to end (recap)

```
INGEST     resume content → chunked by topic → embedded → stored in Chroma
RETRIEVE   user question → embedded → Chroma finds nearest chunks
AUGMENT    system prompt + retrieved chunks + question, combined
GENERATE   combined prompt → LLM → grounded natural-language answer
SERVE      wrapped behind a FastAPI endpoint
DEPLOY     same GitHub Actions → Cloud Run pipeline as the rest of the backend
```
Day 5 covered Ingest and half of Retrieve. Day 6 covered Augment, Generate,
and Serve.

---

# Learning log — Day 6

## 26. From script to reusable function

A script (`query_test.py`) runs top-to-bottom and prints output when executed
directly — nothing happens just from importing it. A FastAPI endpoint needs
something it can *call and get a return value from*, so the same retrieval
logic was extracted into a plain function (`get_relevant_chunks` in
`retrieve.py`) that both the test script and the real endpoint can share,
without duplicating logic.

## 27. System prompt as a versioned file

The system prompt lives in its own file (`app/prompts/ask_me_system.md`)
rather than being a string buried inside Python — the "skill file" pattern
from the original proposal. This keeps prompt content editable and
version-controlled independently from application logic.

## 28. Assembling retrieval + prompt + generation

`chat.py` ties the pieces together: retrieve relevant chunks → join them into
one string with blank-line separators (`"\n\n".join(chunks)`, which signals to
the LLM that these are distinct excerpts rather than one continuous passage,
reducing the chance it blends facts that were never actually adjacent) → send
that combined context plus the question to the chat model.

## 29. FastAPI route conventions

```python
@app.post("/api/chat")          # decorator: HTTP method + URL path
def chat(request: ChatRequest):  # function FastAPI calls for that route
    ...
    return {"answer": answer}    # auto-converted to JSON
```
FastAPI's value over handling raw HTTP by hand: automatic request validation,
automatic JSON conversion, and free interactive docs at `/docs`.

## 30. Pydantic request validation

`class ChatRequest(BaseModel): message: str` *is* input validation — if a
request is missing `message` or sends the wrong type, FastAPI rejects it
automatically (422 error) before the endpoint function even runs. Deeper
validation (length limits, content checks) is a separate, not-yet-added layer.

## 31. Uvicorn — the ASGI server

FastAPI describes *what* endpoints do; Uvicorn is the program that actually
listens on a network port, accepts connections, and hands each request to
FastAPI. FastAPI without a server like Uvicorn is inert code that never
receives anything.

## 32. HTTP vs. framework — untangling the relationship

HTTP is the *protocol* (the rules requests/responses follow). FastAPI is one
*tool*, written in Python, for building a server that speaks that protocol —
Flask, Django, and Express are other tools that speak the same protocol
differently. `curl` talks HTTP to whatever is listening on a port; it has no
awareness of which framework is on the other end.

## 33. Backend directory structure

```
backend/app/
├── main.py              — FastAPI app + all route definitions
├── data/resume_chunks.py — raw content to ingest
├── prompts/ask_me_system.md — system prompt text
└── rag/
    ├── ingest.py         — one-time: embeds chunks, writes to Chroma
    ├── retrieve.py        — reusable: question → relevant chunks
    ├── chat.py             — reusable: question → full answer
    └── query_test.py       — manual test script, not used by the real app
```
Each file has one job; `main.py` → `chat.py` → `retrieve.py` → `chroma_db/`
is the only real dependency chain.

## 34. Why generated data isn't committed

`chroma_db/` is *output*, not source — reproducible any time by re-running
`ingest.py`, and not meaningful to review in a diff (a vector is a wall of
floating-point numbers). Same category of exclusion as `node_modules/` or a
compiled build folder: commit the recipe, not the result of running it.

## 35. Error handling pattern

Convention: keep low-level functions (`get_relevant_chunks`, `answer_question`)
simple and let exceptions propagate; catch and translate errors at the
*endpoint* layer, where there's a clear boundary to a public response.
Catching a specific exception type (`ResourceExhausted` for Gemini rate
limits) allows a specific, honest message; a broader `except Exception`
catches anything else with a generic, safe message — a visitor should never
see a raw Python traceback, which would leak internal file paths and library
details. The real error still gets logged server-side (`logger.exception`)
for actual debugging.

## 36. Agent vs. fixed pipeline — what was actually built

**A fixed pipeline** (what exists now): retrieval runs unconditionally on
every question, in a hardcoded sequence — the LLM never decides *whether* to
look something up.

**A true agent** (industry sense, not yet built): the LLM itself decides which
tool(s) to call, if any, based on reasoning about the specific question — a
capability called **function calling / tool use**. Planned for a later day,
once multiple tools exist for the model to choose between.

## 37. Prompt engineering calibration — where and when

- **System prompt changes** (identity, boundaries, tone): rare, deliberate,
  durable behavior — not tuned per-question.
- **Formatting/output instructions**: iterated more often, based on observed
  failures.
- **Key discipline**: diagnose *which layer* actually failed (retrieval,
  generation, or prompt) before changing anything — prompt tweaks cannot fix
  a wrong answer caused by retrieving the wrong chunk in the first place.

## 38. Production QA controls for an agentic/RAG system

- **Golden eval sets** — fixed question → expected-behavior pairs, re-run
  automatically on every change (planned Day 8; the manual off-topic test
  done today is exactly the kind of case that belongs in that permanent set).
- **Groundedness/faithfulness checks** — verifying an answer doesn't contain
  claims absent from the retrieved context.
- **Boundary/adversarial regression tests** — off-topic refusal, prompt-
  injection attempts ("ignore previous instructions...").
- **Observability** — token usage, latency, error-rate logging per request.
- **Graceful degradation** — known failure modes get specific, calm
  responses rather than generic crashes (implemented today for rate limits).
- **Prompt version control** — treating system prompt edits like code changes,
  reviewed and revertible, not edited live in production.

# Learning log — Day 5 & Day 6: building the RAG chat agent

## 16. Embeddings — the core intuition

An embedding turns a sentence into a list of numbers (a point in a high-dimensional
space) such that sentences with similar *meaning* land near each other — not
similar spelling. "I debugged a flaky test" and "the CI pipeline caught a bug"
end up close together despite sharing almost no words. This is the whole
mechanism retrieval relies on: a user's question gets embedded into that same
space, and whichever stored chunks are *nearest* to it are the relevant ones.

## 17. Prompt engineering — the three-part shape of a system prompt

A good system prompt generally has: **role** ("you're answering questions about
X"), **boundaries** ("if off-topic, decline politely"), and **format guidance**
("keep answers to 2-3 sentences unless asked for more"). Built for real in
`app/prompts/ask_me_system.md` and confirmed working via the off-topic test at
the end of Day 6.

## 18. Content chunking — grouping principle and naming

**Chunking principle:** group by topic coherence, not by arbitrary size — the
goal is that a retrieved chunk is about *one thing*, so the LLM isn't stitching
together loosely related facts from a grab-bag.

**Chunk ID naming, corrected mid-session:** IDs are internal-only (never shown
to a user) but should describe the chunk's *purpose*, not just what happens to
be in it. `dyson_panasonic` (names the companies) was renamed in spirit to
`internship_experience` (names the category) — the second tells you the chunk's
role at a glance, which matters when maintaining the file later.

**Category judgment call, made explicit:** pure academic facts (degree,
university, honours) belong in `education`; recognition (scholarships, the
TikTok Spot Bonus) belongs in a separate `awards` chunk — because "where did she
study" and "what awards has she won" are different question types, and mixing
them means either question retrieves irrelevant content alongside the right answer.
A content *error* was also caught and fixed in this pass: the TikTok bonus had
been miscategorized under education originally.

## 19. Chroma — what it actually is and how it fits the codebase

Chroma is not a separate server the app calls over a network — for a project
this size, it's a Python library running *inside* the same process, writing to
a local folder (`chroma_db/`), conceptually similar to SQLite. Chroma and Gemini
never talk to each other directly; the app's own code is the middleman for both:

- **Ingest time:** app code → Gemini (embed each chunk) → Chroma (store vector + text)
- **Query time:** app code → Gemini (embed the question) → Chroma (find nearest
  vectors, return matching text) → app code → Gemini again (this time as an LLM,
  to write a natural-language answer using that text)

**Industrial practices noted:**
- Always use the *same* embedding model for ingest and query — mixing models
  breaks similarity search, since "nearness" only means something within one
  model's space.
- Asymmetric task types: `task_type="retrieval_document"` at ingest,
  `task_type="retrieval_query"` at query time — good embedding APIs optimize
  these differently since a question and its answer don't look alike as raw text.
- Metadata filtering (attaching category/date to chunks, filtering before
  similarity search) becomes relevant once the data source grows large — not
  needed yet at 9 chunks.

## 20. Why local persistence doesn't survive Cloud Run

Cloud Run gives each container a fresh, empty filesystem on every start,
restart, or scale-up — like a hotel room, not an owned apartment. Nothing
written to disk in a previous run carries over. `PersistentClient`'s local
folder works fine on a laptop (which genuinely persists between runs) but would
silently lose all ingested data the moment this code runs in Cloud Run. **Flagged
as a known gap to fix on a later day** (options noted: re-run ingestion at
container startup, or move Chroma's storage to a mounted volume/cloud bucket) —
not yet resolved.

## 21. Two separate Gemini roles, not one

- **Gemini as an embedding model** (`embed_content`) — turns text into a vector.
  Used twice: once at ingest, once per query.
- **Gemini as an LLM/chat model** (`GenerativeModel(...).generate_content(...)`)
  — a *different* model, takes retrieved text + the question, writes an actual
  answer. Chroma never does this formatting step itself; it only ever returns
  raw stored text.

## 22. RAG end-to-end, the full pipeline

```
INGEST (one-time, or when content changes)
  content → split into topic chunks → embed each → store in vector DB

RETRIEVE (every user question)
  question → embed it → vector DB finds nearest chunks

AUGMENT
  system prompt + retrieved chunks + question → combined prompt

GENERATE
  combined prompt → LLM → grounded answer

SERVE
  wrapped behind a FastAPI endpoint (POST /api/chat)

DEPLOY
  same GitHub Actions → Cloud Run pipeline as the rest of the backend
```
Day 5 covered Ingest and Retrieve; Day 6 covered Augment, Generate, and Serve.

Flow: `main.py` → `chat.answer_question()` → `retrieve.get_relevant_chunks()` →
reads `chroma_db/` (populated earlier by `ingest.py`). Each file has one job.

## 24. Script vs. reusable function — what makes something endpoint-callable

Nothing magic distinguishes them structurally — it's about shape. `query_test.py`
is a script: runs top-to-bottom, prints to console, does nothing on import.
`retrieve.py` defines a *function* (`get_relevant_chunks`) that does nothing on
its own but returns a value when called — which is what an endpoint needs. The
same underlying logic was extracted from the throwaway script into a proper
function specifically so both the test script and the real endpoint could reuse
it without duplication.

## 25. Which endpoints call retrieval, and why just one

Only `/api/chat` calls `get_relevant_chunks()` — as an internal implementation
detail, never exposed to visitors directly. Retrieval isn't a standalone public
capability; it's a helper step inside answering a question. A separate feature
needing search later could reuse the same function without new retrieval logic.

## 26. Error handling convention — where it lives

**Low-level functions stay simple and let exceptions propagate.** The *endpoint*
is where errors get caught and translated into a sensible HTTP response — a
visitor should see "something went wrong, try again," never a raw Python
traceback. Implemented for real at the end of Day 6:
- Catch the *specific* exception type where possible (`ResourceExhausted` for
  Gemini rate limits) → return an honest, specific message ("busy, try again").
- Catch generic `Exception` as a safety net for anything else → return a vague,
  safe message (prevents leaking internal file paths/library details).
- Log the *real* error server-side (`logger.warning` / `logger.exception`) even
  while showing the visitor something generic — debuggability without exposure.
- A generic `500 Internal Server Error` is just FastAPI/Uvicorn's fallback for
  *any* uncaught exception — it's a wrapper, not a diagnosis; the real cause is
  always underneath it in the traceback.

## 27. Prompt assembly — what `"\n\n".join(chunks)` does and why

`chunks` is a list of separate strings; `"\n\n".join(...)` glues them into one
string with a blank line between each. The blank lines are a cheap, effective
signal to the LLM that these are *separate, distinct excerpts* rather than one
continuous paragraph — run-on text with no separation makes it more likely the
model blends facts that were never actually adjacent in the source content.
Retrieved chunks being handed to the LLM as labeled "context" alongside the
question is the standard, textbook shape of RAG — not a project-specific choice.

## 28. FastAPI conventions

```python
@app.get("/some-path")      # decorator: HTTP method + URL path
def function_name():         # called by FastAPI when that URL is hit
    return {"key": "value"}  # auto-converted to JSON
```
FastAPI's value over handling raw HTTP by hand: automatic request validation via
Pydantic models (e.g. `class ChatRequest(BaseModel): message: str` — a request
missing or misdefining `message` gets auto-rejected with a 422 before the
function even runs), automatic JSON conversion both directions, and free
interactive docs at `/docs`.

**Framing correction made explicit:** FastAPI is not an alternative to HTTP —
it *is* HTTP, just a Python framework that makes writing HTTP endpoints far
less tedious than handling raw sockets. `curl` speaks HTTP to whatever's
listening on a port; it has no awareness of which framework (FastAPI, Flask,
Express) is on the other end.

## 29. What Uvicorn is, and why it's separate from FastAPI

FastAPI describes *what* endpoints do; something still has to actually listen
on a network port and hand incoming connections to FastAPI. That's Uvicorn's
job — an ASGI server. FastAPI without a server like Uvicorn running it is inert
code that never receives a request.

## 30. Debugging model-availability errors — a repeatable pattern

Hit twice in one session, each with a different root cause, both real "AI
tooling moves fast" lessons:

- **`text-embedding-004` not found** → the model had been deprecated by Google
  since the original instructions were written. Fixed by switching to
  `gemini-embedding-001`.
- **A typo'd fix** (`text-embedding-001`, which nobody typed intentionally)
  appeared after an editor edit — fixed by verifying the literal file content
  via `grep` rather than trusting the edit happened as described, then
  correcting via a `sed` command run directly in the terminal to avoid further
  editor-autocomplete interference.
- **`gemini-2.0-flash` quota limit: 0`** despite appearing in
  `list_models()` output — the key lesson: **being listed as a permitted model
  and having non-zero free-tier quota are two separate gates.** `list_models()`
  only confirms the first. Fixed by switching to a `-latest` alias
  (`gemini-flash-latest`) rather than a specific version number, since Google
  maintains these aliases to always point at whatever they currently consider
  the free-tier-appropriate model — a more durable choice than hardcoding a
  version that could get its quota reallocated the same way.

**General pattern worth keeping:** when an AI provider's model name fails,
verify against the provider's *current* live behavior (search, or a
`list_models()`-style call) rather than trusting either party's static
knowledge — both a person's instructions and a model's training data can be
stale relative to how fast these APIs change.

## 31. Gemini billing — two separate systems, and a known Google-side bug

**Google Cloud Billing** (the GCP trial credit) and **Gemini API / AI Studio
billing** are entirely separate systems — a GCP trial credit does not fund
Gemini API usage at all, and vice versa. This explains why the resume agent's
LLM calls run under a *different* Google project than the Cloud Run
infrastructure — a real, acknowledged bit of tangle in the setup, not
tidy, but functional and free.

**The specific error hit** ("prepayment credits are depleted" on a fresh
free-tier key) was confirmed, via checking current forum reports, to be a
**known, currently-open Google-side billing-state sync bug** affecting projects
with an active GCP trial specifically — not something caused locally, and not
reliably fixed by enabling billing (multiple reports showed the error
persisting even with billing already active). **Resolution used:** switch to a
different, older API key/project with no GCP trial attached, which sidesteps
the buggy trial-tier ledger entirely.

**Cosmetic, unrelated noise:** the "Failed to send telemetry event" messages
seen throughout are Chroma's own optional, anonymous analytics call failing due
to a harmless version mismatch — confirmed not to affect ingestion or retrieval
correctness in any way, safe to ignore or silence via
`os.environ["ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY"] = "False"`.

## 32. Agent vs. fixed pipeline — a real distinction, not just terminology

What's built as of Day 6 is more precisely a **grounded chatbot / fixed RAG
pipeline**, not yet a full **agent** in the stricter industrial sense — worth
naming the distinction rather than blurring it:

- **What we have:** retrieval runs *unconditionally* on every question,
  hardcoded in `chat.py`. The LLM never decides whether to look something up —
  that decision was made in code, not by the model.
- **What a true agent adds:** the LLM itself decides *whether* and *which*
  tool(s) to call, based on reasoning about the specific question — this
  capability is called **function calling** / **tool use**. E.g., a real agent
  version would offer multiple tools (`search_resume`, `get_project_details`,
  `get_fun_fact`) and let the model choose among them, potentially calling
  several in sequence.
- System prompt for identity/scope: correctly part of "agent" thinking either
  way. Autonomous, LLM-decided tool invocation: not yet implemented — this is
  the explicit target of a later day (multi-tool agent work), not something
  accidentally skipped.

## 33. Where prompt engineering calibration happens, and the guiding principle

- **System prompt changes** (identity, boundaries, tone): rare and deliberate —
  durable behavior, not tuned per-question.
- **Formatting/output instructions**: iterated more frequently, based on
  observed failures (e.g. answers too long → add a length instruction → re-test
  to confirm nothing else broke).
- **General principle:** treat prompt changes like any regression-tested
  system change — alter one variable, re-run the same fixed test set, compare
  results, rather than tuning by feel.
- **Trap to avoid:** using prompt tweaks to paper over a *retrieval* failure.
  If a wrong answer traces back to the wrong chunk being retrieved, no prompt
  wording fixes that — the fix belongs in chunking/retrieval, not the prompt.
  Diagnosing *which layer* actually failed (retrieval vs. generation vs.
  prompt) before changing anything is the real skill, and directly motivates
  building a fixed eval set later (a later day) rather than tuning ad hoc.

## 34. Common production QA controls for an agentic/RAG flow

- **Golden eval sets** — a fixed list of question → expected-behavior pairs,
  run automatically on every prompt or code change (planned for a later day;
  the manual off-topic test just performed is exactly the kind of case that
  belongs permanently in such a set).
- **Groundedness/faithfulness checks** — verifying an answer doesn't contain
  claims absent from the retrieved context (often done via a second LLM call
  grading the first's output against its source context).
- **Boundary/adversarial regression tests** — off-topic refusal (tested today,
  passed) and prompt-injection resistance ("ignore previous instructions...")
  — should become permanent automated tests, not one-off manual checks.
- **Observability** — token usage, latency, and error-rate logging per request
  (planned: Langfuse, later day) — catches quality or cost regressions before a
  user reports them.
- **Graceful degradation** — implemented today: known failure modes (rate
  limits) get a specific, honest response rather than a generic crash.
- **Prompt version control** — the system prompt already lives in its own
  file, tracked like code, rather than edited live in a running system.
